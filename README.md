# monoage-velocity-dispersion

This repo contains the code required to measure the radial and vertical velocity dispersion of stars in the Milky Way disc as a function of age, using APOGEE-Gaia and the APOKASC catalogue.
This code generates all the figures and age catalogues which are included in the paper "Dynamical heating across the Milky Way disc using APOGEE and _Gaia_" (Mackereth et al. 2019). The code here is provided for 'illustration only' purposes and will not be supported/maintained but should allow users to reproduce the main results of that paper.

## Prerequisites

The code will require installation of the [apogee](https://github.com/jobovy/apogee) python package and the [astroNN](https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN) python machine learning package in order to run.
